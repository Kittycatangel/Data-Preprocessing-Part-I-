# Data-Preprocessing-Part-I-

# Introduction

The quality of the data and the amount of useful information that it contains are key factors that determine how well a machine learning algorithm can learn. Therefore, it is absolutely critical that we make sure to examine and preprocess a dataset before we feed it to a learning algorithm. 

A)-Removing and imputing missing values from the dataset
B)-Getting categorical data into shape for machine learning algorithms
C)-Selecting relevant features for the model construction
